## A short history of the Datenzwerg

2023-06-11
: The idea of the Datenzwerg is born at the final day of  [GPN21](https://entropia.de/GPN21), just before a joint bar shift by [@romses](https://chaos.social/@romses) and [@foosel](https://chaos.social/@foosel). 
  Slow parts of the shift as well as the drive back to the Rhein-Main-Area are spent discussing the idea. Romses registers a domain name.

2023-06-30
: romses and foosel meet up for a joint tinkering session. The first two mainboards are built. The Datenzwerg is alive!

2023-07-08
: Another joint tinkering session takes place. Another 8 mainboards are built. The Datenzwerg army is growing!

2023-08-15 - 2023-08-19
: Planned Datenzwerg deployment at [CCCamp23](https://events.ccc.de/camp/2023/infos/).
