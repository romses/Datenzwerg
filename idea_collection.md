  - @Romses @foosel what about a backpack with a rain gauge the temperature problem on the uv sensor could be solved by putting the uv sensor in a parasol #datenzwergAddOn

@axel_hartmann@digitalcourage.social
  - @Romses @foosel 
  - integration to maps.sensor.community ?
  - particulate matter (Feinstaub)
  - ttn mapper / or even a gateway?

@jeroen@secluded.ch
  - @Romses @foosel CO2 and related, Air Quality is extremely important, especially since the ongoing pandemic as high CO2 typically goes hand in hand with bad ventilation

@TabascoEye@chaos.social
  - @Romses @foosel the problem of the UV sensor needing to be in direct sunlight but then the temperature is almost useless should be addressed

@viernullvier@strangeobject.space
  - @Romses @foosel Some way to interact with them would be awesome - a "mystery button" with a simple press counter could be a good start.

@mrtoto@mrtoto.net
  - @Romses @foosel Maybe add solar power to keep them self sustained?

@eldraco@infosec.exchange
  - @Romses @foosel how to reproduce. Online public api to send data. No sensor that i Can think of
